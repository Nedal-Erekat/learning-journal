##### How you can benefit from a growth mindset

The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and *possibility*, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

- Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset
  1. Challenges
  2. Obstacles
  3. Effort 
     - true phrase `no pain, no gain` is pure growth mindset!
- Growing at work, and outside work too
 ***I’ve been guilty of having _a fixed mindset_ far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a ~~society~~ where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.***
