### A Script is a sereies of instructions. To write a script, you need to first stat your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achive it. 

## Objects :
#### each object can have it's own:
- Properties.
- Events.
- Methods.

## instans:
is asingle object.

>the object and the instance together thay creat _model_.

## Expressions:
#### Rely on operators to calculat a value.
* there are two of expression:
  - Just assign the value with variable.
    > var color= 'beige';
  - use two or more values to return a single value
    > var area = 3x2;

# Operatores:
#### There are different operatorrs we can use like:
> "+ - * / and others."
#### Moreover, there is a single string operator and we call it _concatenation_
> FiretName + lastName, assum that the two statement are var data type.

## Functions:
#### Group a series of atatements together to perform a specific task. And we can perform the task later, need to give name which discribe the taske and this is known as ***calling function***
 
 ### Function decleration:
 #### there are two form to make a function:
 1. function functionName() {statment code"document.write(HEllo!)"};
 2. var functionName= function(){code..};
 - any time you can call the function by typing his name any where in html page.
 > functionName();

 * the diferance between the Local and global variable is that, tha local is inside the function but the global is out side the function.
